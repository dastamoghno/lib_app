Wheels are precompiled binaries for all linux platforms using the manylinux2010 tag. In the following, replace python with python3 for Python 3. To install first update pip:

$ python -m pip install --upgrade --user pip setuptools virtualenv

Then make and load the virtualenv. This is optional, but highly recommended:

$ python -m virtualenv ~/kivy_venv
$ source ~/kivy_venv/bin/activate

Finally install the Kivy wheel and optionally the kivy-examples:

$ python -m pip install kivy
$ python -m pip install kivy_examples

Gstreamer is not included, so if you would like to use media playback with kivy, you should install ffpyplayer like so

$ python -m pip install ffpyplayer

Make sure to set KIVY_VIDEO=ffpyplayer env variable before running the app. Only Python 3.5+ is supported.
